## [1. Introduction](#table-of-contents)
### [1.1. Using this Guide](#1-introduction)
This guide is intended to help you get started with PressPlanner. It will guide you through the installation process, provide a brief overview of the app's features, and give you a quick reference to the commands you can use. All sections headers will link you back to the start of their parent section, so you can easily navigate the guide.
### [1.2. Why Use PressPlanner?](#1-introduction)
PressPlanner was built with **freelance journalists in mind**. It acts as your digital address book and database, helping you keep track of your contacts and articles.

Unlike major firms, freelancers often lack the same wealth of contacts and resources. PressPlanner helps you maximise the value you can get from your contacts, by providing a platform to store and manage them and keeping track of which contacts you've worked with for different articles.

PressPlanner's main features are its ability to help you:
1. Develop deeper story angles and reconnect with past interviewees or collaborators.
   - [Filter](#326-filtering-articles--filter--a) by tags to find past articles on a specific topic.
   - [Lookup](#328-lookup-associated-persons--lookup--a) persons of interest related to those past articles.
   - Contact these persons for interviews or collaboration.


2. Follow up on breaking stories
   - [Filter](#326-filtering-articles--filter--a) by status and tags to find published articles related to breaking news.
   - Make changes to your article as the story develops.

PressPlanner's tagging system for [persons](#31-managing-contacts) and [articles](#32-managing-articles) is flexible and powerful:
- Customise your use of tags and still leverage the app's search and filter functions.

## [2. Getting Started](#table-of-contents)

### [2.1. Installation](#2-getting-started)
1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.
    - Download Java 11 from [the official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
    - If you are unsure what version of java you have, use [this guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html) to check.
1. Download the jar file from [our latest release](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases).
1. Move it to an **Empty** folder.

> :warning: 
> App data will be stored in sub-folders from where it is launched. While you could run the app from any location, we recommend making a dedicated folder for our app to avoid confusion.

### [2.2. Launching the App](#2-getting-started)
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar pressplanner.jar` command to run the application.
1. A window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

### [2.3. The Beginner's Guide to PressPlanner](#2-getting-started)

> :bulb:
> This section covers commands first-time users might need. For the full commands list, refer to the [Features](#3-features) section.

Let's go over the basic PressPlanner workflow. Say you've just finished interviewing a certain Gill Bates about his company's latest product. You want to save his contact for later and keep track of your article. Let's fire up PressPlanner and get this task out of the way.

1. Selecting the command box at the top of the page, let's first add Gill Bates to PressPlanner's address book list.
    - To `add` a contact we need to include the following information separated by their prefixes:
        - Name (`n/`)
        - Phone number (`p/`)
        - Email (`e/`)
        - Address (`a/`)
    - For example: `add n/Gill Bates p/12345678 e/gillbates@sicromoft.com a/Sicromoft HQ`



> :bulb:
> Adding an article uses the `add -a` command, the `-a` standing for article. The `-a` suffix is used for all commands pertaining to articles.

2. Next let's add that article you just wrote.
   - To `add -a` an article we need the following information:
       - Headline (`h/`)
       - Date (`d/`)
         - We use a single field for the date:
           - For drafts, you can use the date you started writing the article.
           - For published articles, use the date of publication.
       - Status (`s/`)
         - An article can be a `draft`, `published`, or `archived`.
     - For example: `add -a h/My Article d/20-10-2023 s/draft`

3. Now that that's done, let's say you need to find Gill Bate's number to arrange another interview.
    - Typing the command `find Gill Bates` will pull up his contact.

4. If you made a mistake or want to see all your contacts again:
    - Typing the command `list` will bring up all your contacts.

5. If you want to look up your article:
    - Typing the command `find -a My First Article` will pull up the article.

6. If you want to see all your articles again:
    - Typing the command `list -a` will bring them all up.

Now that you know the basic workflow, go ahead and try it out for yourself. If you want to learn more commands, use the `help` command in-app or refer to the [features](#3-features) section of this guide.

As you become more familiar with the app, use tags as you see fit to customise your workflow!
- Here are some ideas to get you started:
  - Using tags to rate interviewees' compliance and reliability.
  - Noting down how many clicks articles got in the first 24 hours.
  - Using tags to mark articles with potential for follow-up development.

## [3. Features](#table-of-contents)
<div class="callout-box">
Notes about the command format:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times. If the item is also in square brackets, it can even be used zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

    * It is case insensitive. (e.g. `John` in the address book will match `john` as an interviewee or contributor in the article).
    * It is a full word match. (e.g. `John` in the address book will not match `Johnny` or `John Doe` as an interviewee or contributor in the article).

Examples:
* `lookup 1` returns all persons associated with the first article in the list of articles.

### [3.1.7. Sorting Persons by Name : `sort n/`](#31-managing-contacts)

Sorts persons in ascending order by the lexicographical (alphabetical) ordering of their names.

Format: `sort n/`

* Executing the `sort n/` command sorts all persons in PressPlanner permanently.
  * This works differently from commands which change the current view temporarily (e.g. [find](#315-searching-person-by-name-find)).
  * Closing and reopening the app in future will result in contacts remaining sorted by name.
* Sorting is only done when the command is executed and not automatically maintained afterwards:
    * A person added using `add` after a `sort n/` command will be added to the end of the address book, regardless of their name.
    * A person edited using `edit` to change their name after a `sort n/` command will not change its position in the address book.

    * e.g. `delete 1` after the `find` command deletes the first article found by the `find` command.
* If `INDEX` exceeds the number of articles in the list, an error message is printed.
* `INDEX` should be a positive integer, if not, an error message will be printed.

  * e.g. `filter -a s/ t/ st/ en/` is a valid command
  * e.g. `filter -a s/ t/ st/` is not a valid command
  * Leaving `st/` or `en/` blank defaults to the earliest or latest date possible respectively.
* Use the `filter` command **prior to a `find` command**.
  * `filter` will list all matching articles within the database when first applied.
  * `find` can be used to then search the filtered list.
    * Using `filter` after a `find` command will overwrite the previous `find` command.
* Filters are not stored between sessions, so make sure to finish your search before closing the app!
* Filters will apply until you [remove](#327-removing-a-filter--rmfilter--a) it or apply a new filter, so make sure you [remove](#327-removing-a-filter--rmfilter--a) it after you are done!
* Refer to the [add article](#322-adding-an-article--add--a) command for the format of each field.
  * Note that `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must be in the same format as `DATE` in the [add article](#322-adding-an-article--add--a) command.

Examples:
* `filter -a s/draft t/ st/ en/` will restrict the display to showing only articles with draft status.

### [3.2.7. Removing a Filter : `rmfilter -a`](#32-managing-articles)
Remove all filters so that all articles in PressPlanner's database are displayed.

* If `INDEX` exceeds the number of articles in the displayed database, an error message is printed.
* `INDEX` should be a positive integer, if not, an error message will be printed.
* The matching of articles to persons is based on the person's name.
    * It is case insensitive. (e.g. `john` as an interviewee or contributor in the article will match `John` in the address book).
    * It is a full word match. (e.g. `John` as an interviewee or contributor in the article will not match `Johnny` or `John Doe` in the address book).
  
Examples:
* `lookup -a 1` returns all persons associated with the first article in the list of articles.

### [3.2.9. Sorting Articles by Date : `sort -a d/`](#32-managing-articles)

Sorts articles in PressPlanner's database in descending order by their date and time.

Format: `sort -a d/`

## [5. FAQs](#table-of-contents)
### [5.1. Why am I unable to run PressPlanner on my desktop?](#5-faqs)
* Please check that you have downloaded Version 11 Java SDK that suits your computer’s operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
* If you are unsure of whether you have done so, please navigate back to the “Getting Started” Segment of the User Guide to access the link which will bring you to the Java Oracle Website where you can re-download the Version 11 Java SDK for your operating system.

### [5.2. How do I ensure that I have saved all the contacts and articles I have added in this session?](#5-faqs)
* Do not worry about issues regarding the saving of data you have entered into the application, they are saved into files automatically upon the execution of every command which modifies or adds new data.

### [5.3. Why were all my previous data for contacts (and / or) articles from previous sessions deleted and replaced by the default template data?](#5-faqs)
* This means that your save file was either corrupted or lost. To avoid this, refrain from editing files in the data folder (specifically **AddressBook.json** and **ArticleBook.json** files which contain the saved contacts and articles respectively, from previous sessions) unless you are sure about what you are doing.
* To mitigate possible accidental data corruption which may result in the deletion of any of the save files, please make a copy of the data files after every session where major changes were made, so that in the event the most recent data is lost, you would still have a recent data file which can then be added back into the data folder located at the working directory of the PressPlanner.jar file and be loaded up into the application.

### [5.4. Why does my link not open the browser?](#5-faqs)
* This means that your URL added to the PressPlanner is an invalid link.
* To let you know when the URL is invalid, we will soon be implementing the app to show you an error message when your link that is typed is invalid. Please wait for our future updates!
